one, refrence the google doc i left you

second, for this MVP, we need:

An enemy that takes actions based on its enviornment (moves unless it hits a wall)

A character that has a mele and a gun (i.e full geometric support)

Input from the keyboard

A way to draw sprites on the screen

Dying

A menu to restart the game

Anything above this can crash and burn
