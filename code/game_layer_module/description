This folder consists of the game layer module.
This module is concerned with managing data on a per-encounter basis,
providing an API for the weapons, entities, and enviornment to use.

It is not concerned with traking currency, progression, unlocks, or specific implementations. 


The classes in this module are:

GameLayer - A class that stores and manages data for the entities on a per-encounter basis. It stores information about each cell in an array of GameNodes.

GameNode - A class that represent a tile on the board. This includes the state of the tile, the entity (if any) on the tile, and provides functions to interface with the entity/tile it represents

GamePos - A 2D vector representing a position on the board. Currently it exists without a link to GameLayer, this may be changed in future.
